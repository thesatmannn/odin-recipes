    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds thick-cut, bone-in ribeye steak</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>6 large onions, sliced 1/2 inch thick</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh tyhme, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups dry white wine</li>
        <li>1(32 ounce) carton reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>4 slices artisinal-style bread</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded white cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle steak with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat butter and oil in a 6-quart Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add steak; sear for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove steak; drain all but 1 tablespoon drippings. Stir in onions and thyme; cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are tender, about 15 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil, stirring with a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits. Boil until wine is reduced by half, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut steak from the bones and chop into 1-inch pieces; transfer to the pot. Add broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until beef is very tender, about 3 hours. Add water as needed to keep onions and beef covered.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange bread on a small baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake bread in the preheated oven until toasted, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard bones and thyme sprigs from the pot. Skim off any excess fat. Stir in remaining salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack 4 to 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Divide soup among 4 oven-proof bowls or mugs; arrange on a large foil-lined baking sheet. Top each bowl with toast and cheeses.</li>
        <li>Broil soups until cheese is browned and bubbly, 1 to 2 minutes. Watch closely to prevent burning.</li>
    </ol>
